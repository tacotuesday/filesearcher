# filesearcher
Small program to spider a directory and count imports. Works natively with Lua; currently working to expand extensibility

## Potential future steps:
* Turn script into a function
* Create argument vector support. (Via `argv` or `import()`?)
* Have a good time. `(•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)`
